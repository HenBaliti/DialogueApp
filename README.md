Dialogue - Android App (Java)


This is a project we developed during our android course in our 3rd year. This project was made in android studio using Java + FireBase. we implemented the MVC design pattern in this application.
The Dialogue app was made to help connect between student and private teachers around the globe. Each user can open a profile and start learning or teaching based on his knowledge.
